      <h1>About Pokemon</h1>
      <p>
        Pokemon is a Japanese media franchise managed by The Pokémon Company, a
        company founded by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. The franchise
        was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1996,[4] and is centered on fictional
        creatures called "Pokémon". In Pokémon, humans, known as Pokémon
        Trainers, catch and train Pokémon to battle other Pokémon for sport. All
        media works within the franchise are set in the Pokémon universe. The
        English slogan for the franchise is "Gotta Catch ‘Em All!".[5][6] There
        are currently 913 Pokémon species.[7] The franchise began as Pocket
        Monsters: Red and Green (later released outside of Japan as Pokémon Red
        and Blue), a pair of video games for the original Game Boy handheld
        system that were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo in
        February 1996. It soon became a media mix franchise adapted into various
        different media.[8] Pokémon is estimated to be the highest-grossing
        media franchise of all time. The Pokémon video game series is the fourth
        best-selling video game franchise of all time with more than 440 million
        copies sold
